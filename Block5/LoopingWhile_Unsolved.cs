			// Make a while loop that will print out 5 cookies one at a time

			//because you can set the update conditionally
			//it is easy to forget it... or to accidently
			//create an infinite loop by using a bad condition
			// Make a while loop with an infinite loop
			// ==================== INSERT CODE BELOW ====================




			//Virtually every time you have an infinite loop
			//you wrote the condition wrong.

			//Write a while loop that starts with 10 bags of groceries
			//and counts down as they are unloaded until there are none
			//remaining.
			// ==================== INSERT CODE BELOW ====================




			//It is most common to use a while loop with a bool
			//for a counter as this allows us to conditionally
			//change the bool for when we want to exit the loop
			// make a while loop using a bool as the conditional statement
			// ==================== INSERT CODE BELOW ====================




			//PROGRAMMER REAL WORLD EXAMPLE
			//for Loops are great for a specific number of times to loop
			//They are ideal when you know the COUNT

			//While loops are great for an indeterminable number of times
			//They are ideal when you know the CONDITION
			// Ask the user if that want to play a game and use their conditional response to run a while loop
			// ==================== INSERT CODE BELOW ====================
